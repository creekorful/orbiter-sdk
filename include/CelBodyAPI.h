	* \page planetmod Planet Modules
	*
	* \details Planet modules can be used to control the motion of a planet (or any other celestial body,
	*  such as a moon, the sun, or an asteroid) within the solar system. This allows to implement
	*  sophisticated analytic ephemerides solutions which take into account perturbations from other
	*  celestial objects.
	*
	*  Planets which are not controlled via a DLL module are updated directly by Orbiter. Depending
	*  on the settings in the definition file, Orbiter either uses an unperturbed 2-body approximation,
	*  resulting in a conic section trajectory (e.g. an ellipse), or uses a dynamic update procedure
	*  based on the gravitational forces acting on the planet. Both methods have limitations: the 2-
	*  body approach ignores perturbations and is only valid if no massive bodies other than the
	*  orbit reference object are nearby. The dynamic update accumulates numerical errors over
	*  time, causing the orbits slowly to diverge from the correct trajectories.
	*
	*  By using a planet module, analytic perturbation solutions can be used which avoid the shortcomings
	*  of the methods described above. Perturbation solutions typically describe the perturbed
	*  orbit of a planet by expressing the state vectors as a trigonometric series. These series
	*  are valid over a limited period of time, after which they start to diverge. Examples of perturbation
	*  solutions used in Orbiter are the VSOP87 solution for the 8 major planets and the sun, or
	*  the ELP2000 solution for the moon.
	*
	*  Planet modules have one additional function: They can be used to define some atmospheric
	*  parameters, such as temperature, pressure and density as a function of altitude. Additional
	*  functions may be added to the planet module interface in the future.
	*
	* \section first_steps First Steps:
	*  To start on your planet module, you should create a new "dynamic link library" project with
	*  your C++ compiler. Add the \e Orbiter.lib and \e Orbitersdk.lib files to the project (<i>found in
	*  Orbitersdk\\lib</i>). Add <i>Orbitersdk\\include</i> to your include path. Create a C++ source 
	*  file for your project, and add the essential API interface functions:
	*
	* \code
	*  #define ORBITER_MODULE
	*  #include "OrbiterAPI.h"
	*  #include "CelbodyAPI.h"
	*
	*  DLLCLBK void InitModule (HINSTANCE hModule)
	*  {
	*     // module initialisation
	*  }
	*
	*  DLLCLBK void ExitModule (HINSTANCE hModule)
	*  {
	*     // module cleanup
	*  }
	*
	*  DLLCKBK CELBODY *InitInstance (OBJHANDLE hBody)
	*  {
	*     // instance initialisation
	*     return new MyPlanet;
	*  }
	*
	*  DLLCLBK void ExitInstance (CELBODY *body)
	*  {
	*     // instance cleanup
	*     delete (MyPlanet*)body;
	*  }
	* \endcode
	*
	* The first line defining \c ORBITER_MODULE is required to ensure that all initialisation functions
	* are properly called by Orbiter.
	*
	* OrbiterAPI.h contains the general API interface, and CelBodyAPI.h contains the planet module-
	* specific interface, in particular the \c CELBODY class, which will be discussed below.
	*
	* The \e InitModule() and \e ExitModule() methods are called only once per Orbiter session, when the
	* DLL module is loaded or unloaded, respectively. They can be used to set up global parameters.
	* You can omit them if your module doesn't need any such initialisation.
	*
	* The \e InitInstance() and \e ExitInstance() functions are more important: You use them to create and
	* destroy an instance of your planet class. This class is derived from \c CELBODY. In this example,
	* we called it MyPlanet.
    *
	* \section class_interface The CELBODY interface class
	*
	* All communication between Orbiter and your planet module will be conducted via the methods
	* of the derived planet class. You overload the various callback functions of the \c CELBODY
	* class to add the required functionality. Check the API Reference manual for a complete list of
	* class methods. A typical implementation might look like this:
	* \code
	*  class MyPlanet: public CELBODY 
	*  {
	*  public:
	*         MyPlanet();
	*    bool bEphemeris() const;
	*    void clbkInit (FILEHANDLE cfg);
	*    int  clbkEphemeris (double mjd, int req, double *ret);
	*    int  clbkFastEphemeris (double simt, int req, double *ret);
	*  };
	* \endcode
	*
	* \code
	*  MyPlanet::MyPlanet(): CELBODY()
	*  {
	*     // add constructor code here
	*  }
	*
	*  bool MyPlanet::bEphemeris() const
	*  {
	*     return true; // class supports ephemeris calculation
	*  }
	*
	*  void MyPlanet::clbkInit (FILEHANDLE cfg)
	*  {
	*    // read parameters from config file (e.g. tolerance limits, etc)
	*    // perform any required initialisation (e.g. read perturbation terms from data files)
	*  }
	*
	*  int MyPlanet::clbkEphemeris (double mjd, int req, double *ret)
	*  {
	*    // return planet position and velocity for Modified Julian date mjd in ret
	*  }
	*
	*  int MyPlanet::clbkFastEphemeris (double simt, int req, double *ret)
	*  {
	*    // return interpolated planet position and velocity for simulation time simt in ret
	*  }
	* \endcode
	*
	* \e clbkEphemeris() and \e clbkFastEphemeris() are the functions which will contain the actual
	* ephemeris calculations for the planet at the requested time. \e clbkEphemeris() is only called by
	* Orbiter if the planet's state at an arbitrary time is required (for example by an instrument
	* calculating the position at some future time). When Orbiter updates the planet's position for
	* the next simulation time frame, the \e clbkFastEphemeris() function will be called instead. This
	* means that \e clbkFastEphemeris() will be called at each frame, each time advancing the time by
	* a small amount. This can be used for a more efficient calculation. Instead of performing a full
	* series evaluation, which can be lengthy, you may implement an interpolation scheme which
	* performs the full calculation only occasionally, and interpolates between these samples to
	* return the state at an intermediate time.
	*
	* For both functions, the requested type of data is specified as a group of \c EPHEM_xxx bitflags
	* in the req parameter. (see \c CELBODY) This can be any combination of position and velocity data for the
	* celesital body itself and/or the barycentre of the system defined by the body and all its
	* children (moons). The functions should calculate all required data, either in cartesian or polar
	* coordinates, and fill the ret array with the results. ret contains 12 entries, used as follows:\n
	*
	* ret[0-2]: true position\n
	* ret[3-5]: true velocity\n
	* ret[6-8]: barycentric position\n
	* ret[9-11]: barycentric velocity\n
	*
	* Only the fields requested by req need to be filled. In cartesian coordinates, the position fields
	* must contain the x, y and z coordinates in [m], and the velocity fields must contain the
	* velocities dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt in [m/s]. In spherical polar coordinates, the position fields must
	* contain longitude j [rad], latitude q [rad] and radial distance r [AU], and the velocity fields
	* must contain the polar velocities dj/dt [rad/s], dq/dt [rad/s] and dr/dt [AU/s].
	*
	* The functions should indicate the fields actually calculated via the return value. This is in
	* particular important if not all requests could be satisified (e.g. position and velocity was
	* requested, but only position could be calculated). The return value is interpreted as a bitflag
	* that can contain the same \c EPHEM_xxx flags as the req parameter. If all requests could be
	* satisfied, it should be identical to req. In addition, the return value should contain additional
	* flags indicating the properties of the returned data, including \c EPHEM_POLAR if the data are
	* returned as spherical polar coordinates, or \c EPHEM_TRUEISBARY if the true and barycentric
	* coordinates are identical (i.e. the celestial body does not have child bodies).
	*
	* \note The older standalone module callback functions (opcXXX) are obsolete and should no 
	*  longer be used.

	* \note Data can be returned in either polar or cartesian format. In cartesian format,

	* \note If both true and barycentric data are requested, but are computationally
	*  expensive to compute (for example, if they require two separate series
	*  evaluations), the module can return true positions only. Orbiter will then

	*  parent body's true position, this flag should not be included.
	* \note This function is not called by Orbiter to update the planet's position during
	*  the normal simulation frame update. (For that purpose, clbkFastEphemeris() is
