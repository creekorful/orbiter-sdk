<h1>Angular velocity</h1>
<p>
Use these controls to define the vessel's angular velocity around its three principal axes. You can adjust the velocity of rotation around the x-axis (pitch rate), y-axis (yaw rate) and z-axis (bank rate).
<p>
To terminate the vessel spin altogether, press the <i>Kill</i> button.
<p>
Note that the angular velocity components can oscillate between the three axes, depending on the vessel's principal moments of inertia (PMI). This means that pressing the <i<>Refresh</i> button repeatedly may change the angular velocity values in the three axes, even if no additional torque is applied.
<p>
Likewise, pressing the <i>Apply</i> button repeatedly with the same angular velocity values can lead to abrupt changes in the vessel spin.
<p>
The angular velocity settings have no effect for vessels on the ground.
