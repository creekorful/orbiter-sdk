<h1>Surface location</h1>
Applying options from this page will place your vessel on the surface of a planet or moon.
<p>
First you should select in the <i>Celestial body</i> box the body on which to place the vessel.
<p>
If applicable, select a spaceport in the <i>Surface base</i> box, and a <i>Landing pad</i> for your vessel.
<p>
Alternatively, you can directly input the equatorial coordinates of your landing site in the <i>Longitude</i> and <i>Latitude</i> boxes.
<p>
Use the <i>Heading</i> box to adjust the orientation of your vessel on the ground.
<p>
You can use the spin buttons next to the <i>Longitude</i>, <i>Latitude</i> and <i>Heading</i> boxes to adjust the values (small spinners scroll by small amounts, large spinners scroll by large amounts).
<p>
If you enter numerical values directly, you must press <i>Apply</i> to register the new values.
<p>
In the current version, docked assemblies of vessels on the ground are not supported. Therefore avoid assigning a surface position to a vessel that is part of a docked superstructure.
<p>
<h2>Copy state</h2>
Similar to the <i>Status vector</i> page, the <i>Surface location</i> page provides a list of vessels from which the surface parameters can be copied over. All vessels in the list are currently landed on a planetary surface. By clicking on an entry in the list, that vessel’s surface parameters are copied into the scenario editor page. You can then click <i>Apply</i> to move your spacecraft to the specified vessel’s location. Alternatively, double-clicking applies the copied parameters immediately.
Once you copied your spacecraft onto the other vessel, you can then edit the surface position parameters to fine-tune the relative position and heading of the two vessels.
