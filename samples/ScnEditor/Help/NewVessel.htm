<h1>Creating a new vessel</h1>
<p>
After clicking the <i>New</i> button on the main page, the editor will display the vessel creation page. It shows a list of all spacecraft types recognised by Orbiter. Select a type from the list, and enter a unique vessel name in the edit box above. 
If you forget to select a vessel name or type, or try to enter a name that is already in use, the editor will not allow you to proceed.
<p>
If you want the simulation to display the new vessel as soon as it is created, tick the <i>Set camera</i> box.
<p>
In addition, you can tick the <i>Set input focus</i> box to make the new vessel the focus object to receive user input via keyboard, mouse and joystick. Note that some vessel types may not accept input focus.
<p>
Click the <i>Create</i> button to generate the new vessel. All new vessels are placed in a default location (usually in a low Earth orbit).
<p>
The editor now switches into <i>Configuration</i> mode. From here you can set its position, orientation and other state parameters.
