<h1>Vessel orientation</h1>
<p>
This page allows to change the orientation of a vessel in free flight. You can either specify the <i>Euler angles</i> of the vessel frame with respect to the global ecliptic frame of reference, or you can <i>rotate</i> the vessel around its pitch, yaw and bank axes.
<p>
The Euler angles <i>&alpha;</i>, <i>&beta;</i> and <i>&gamma;</i> define the rotation matrix <b>R</b> which transforms from the vessel local frame to the global ecliptic frame as follows:

<p>
More intuitively, you can rotate the vessel around its local axes by pressing the pitch, yaw and bank buttons. The pitch buttons rotate around the vessel x-axis, the yaw buttons around the y-axis, and the bank buttons around the z-axis.
<p>
If the vessel is part of a composite structure (e.g. a spacecraft docked to a space station), the whole structure will be rotated.
<p>
The rotation settings have no effect for vessels on the ground.
